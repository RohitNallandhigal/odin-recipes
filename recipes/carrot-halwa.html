        <ol>
            <li><p>Combine carrots, milk, and sugar in a 6- to 8-qt. Dutch oven; bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
            <li><p>Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated, about 1 hour.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin to break open cardamom pods. Coarsely crush seeds, discarding the shells. (If using ground cardamom, skip this step.)</p></li>
